# Bootstrap Layouts

- In this lab we will be coding layouts based on mockups (images) using the Bootstrap library.
- Your goal is to recreate the layouts using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap, utilizing as many Bootstrap components as possible for the desired outcome.

### Google-Style Login
- You will need a gradient background for the body of your document. A great resource for generating these can be found [here](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/).
- You may want to research the [`border-radius`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) and [`box-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) properties.
- A nice box shadow generator can be found [here](http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow).

### Twitter Profile Card
- Play with margins here. Remember that margins can also go negative.

### Resume
- This is meant to be a creative activity. Use the attached mockup only as an example of the elements you need to include, but feel free to change the look and feel to suit your style.
- You may want to make use of [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts), as well as Bootstrap Glyphicons.

### Bonus (Advanced): Cool Social Media Icons
- For this mockup you will need to use a combination of techniques to achieve the desired result.
- You may want to research [CSS transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform).
- Additionally, make sure that when the mouse hovers over the icons they increase in size slightly. You may want to research [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) and [`scale`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scale).
- Additionally, for the icons you will need an external library. [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is a great library that is packed with icons that you can use for free in your projects.
